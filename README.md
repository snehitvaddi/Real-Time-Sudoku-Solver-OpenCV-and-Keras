## How to Run!!
Step-1: Install all required libraries in `requirements.txt` or directly run `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
Step-2: Directly run all cells of `Sudoku testing.ipynb` file. It does all the imports by itself.<br>
Step-3: Nothing else, just get your Sudoku puzzle in front of your camera and get the real-time solutions.<br>
Step-2: To stop the camera, click 'Q' on keyboard.

## Note:
I already trained my keras model to predict digits. You can try your custom model to predict similarly!!
